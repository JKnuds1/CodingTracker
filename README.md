This program is a CRUD console app for tracking coding sessions. Either by adding the start and end times manually 
or by starting a timer that logs the length of the session automatically.
# Features

# Lessons
This project familiarized me we with how OOP works in C#. As well as how to interact with a database through an 
application. Both of which I will get used for and improve upon later in my coding journey.
